*) To install Docker on an Ubuntu server, you can follow these steps:
    Update Package Lists:
        Open a terminal on your Ubuntu server and run the following command to ensure your package lists are up to date:
            sudo apt update
            Install Dependencies:

    Install the required dependencies that allow apt to use packages over HTTPS:
        sudo apt install apt-transport-https ca-certificates curl software-properties-common

    Add Docker Repository:
    Add the Docker repository to your system's package sources:

        curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg | sudo gpg --dearmor -o /usr/share/keyrings/docker-archive-keyring.gpg
        echo "deb [arch=amd64 signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/docker-archive-keyring.gpg] https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu $(lsb_release -cs) stable" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/docker.list > /dev/null

    Install Docker Engine:
        Update the package lists again and install Docker:
            sudo apt update
            sudo apt install docker-ce docker-ce-cli containerd.io

    Start and Enable Docker:
        Start the Docker service and enable it to start on boot:
            sudo systemctl start docker
            sudo systemctl enable docker

    Verify Docker Installation:
        Check that Docker is installed and running:
            sudo docker --version
            sudo docker run hello-world

    Manage Docker as a Non-Root User (Optional):
    If you want to avoid using sudo with every Docker command, you can add your user to the docker group:
            sudo usermod -aG docker $USER

    Remember that you'll need to log out and back in for this group change to take effect.
    That's it! You've successfully installed Docker on your Ubuntu server. You can now use Docker to create, run, and manage containers.
