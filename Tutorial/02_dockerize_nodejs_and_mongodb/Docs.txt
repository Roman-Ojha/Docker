*) Overview:
    -> We will create dockerfile
    -> We want to use docker-compose file so that Mongodb will run on separate container and want them to talk to each other
    -> Initialize you project from 
        -> https://github.com/bradtraversy/docker-node-mongo/tree/master
    *) To run NodeJS and Mongodb We need to container:
        1) Nodejs API container
        2) MongoDB container
    -> https://hub.docker.com/_/node
    -> https://hub.docker.com/_/mongo

*) Steps
    => DockerFile for NodeJS
        -> Now we will create the 'Dockerfile' for NodeJS application
        -> this will allow to create container for nodejs application
    => docker-compose:
        -> which will start all the necessary necessary container to run this application 
    => we can manually create container for mongodb but we also want to easily port to another system and docker-compose allows us to do that
    => Command:
        -> docker compose up (to run docker-compose.yml)
        -> docker compose down (to remove container, network)

*) Deploy application to DigitalOcean with docker:
