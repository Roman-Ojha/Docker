*) Debugging Container:
    -> docker logs <container_id> (to see all the logs that container is producing)
    -> docker logs <container_name> (to see all the logs of container by providing the container name that every container have unique name which you can use using 'docker ps')
    -> docker exec -it <container_id|name> /bin/bash (get terminal of the running container)
        -> -it: interactive terminal
        -> exit (exit terminal)

    -> docker exec -i -t <Container ID> sh (to go inside the shell of that container and run can other command as well)
            -> sh (it will run the shell terminal inside the given container)
    -> docker exec -it <container_id> /bin/sh
    -> docker exec -it <container_id> /bin/bash (interactive bash terminal)
    
    -> docker logs <container_name> | tail (get last part of the logs)
    
    -> docker logs <container_name> -f (stream the logs in live)

    -> to install package inside container you have 'apk'
    	-> apk add <package_name>
	-> apk --help
	-> apk -h
