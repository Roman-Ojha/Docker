*) RUN Instruction:
    -> 'RUN' has 2 forms:
        -> 'RUN' <command> (shell form, the command is run in a shell, which by default is '/bin/sh -c' on Linux or 'cmd /S /C' on Windows)
        -> 'RUN' ["executable", "param1", "param2"] (exec form)
    
    -> The 'RUN' instruction will execute any commands in a new layer on top of the current image and commit the results. The resulting committed image will be used for the next step in the 'Dockerfile'.
    -> The exec form makes it possible to avoid shell string munging, and to 'RUN' commands using a base image that does not contain the specified shell executable.
    -> In exec form it doesn't start the Shell session.
    -> The default shell for the shell form can be changed using the 'SHELL' command.
    -> The cache for RUN instructions isn't invalidated automatically during the next build. The cache for an instruction like 'RUN apt-get dist-upgrade -y' will be reused during the next build. The cache for RUN instructions can be invalidated by using the '--no-cache' flag, for example docker build --no-cache.
