*) Dockerfile
    -> https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/
    -> using this we will build our own docker image for our project.
    -> EX: 
        -> In this './01_Dockerfile.png' diagram we can see that, we have developed the javascript application, we have used the mongodb container now it is time to commit to git.
        -> So we will simulate this steps in local environment
        -> After commit you have CI that run it could be using 'Jenkins' or Github action.
        -> So what doesn't Jenkins do in this application:
            -> So when it build the application
            -> it packages them in the docker image 
            -> and then push is to docker Repository
        -> So here we will simulate what Jenkins does with our application and how it packages into a Docker image on local environment.

    *) What is Dockerfile:
        -> In order to build and docker image from an application we have to copy the content of the application on the docker files, it could be an artifact that we build and then we will going to configure it in order to do that we will going to use Bluprint for buildig Images which is called as a Dockerfile.
        -> So, Dockerfile is the blueprint for creating Docker Images.
        -> Here is the format of the Dockerfile:
            # Comment
            INSTRUCTION arguments
