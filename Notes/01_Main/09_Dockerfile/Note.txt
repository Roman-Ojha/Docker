    -> using this we will build our own docker image for our project.
    -> EX: 
        -> In this './01_Dockerfile.png' diagram we can see that, we have developed the javascript application, we have used the mongodb container now it is time to commit to git.
        -> So we will simulate this steps in local environment
        -> After commit you have CI that run it could be using 'Jenkins' or Github action.
        -> So what doesn't Jenkins do in this application:
            -> So when it build the application
            -> it packages them in the docker image 
            -> and then push is to docker Repository
        -> So here we will simulate what Jenkins does with our application and how it packages into a Docker image on local environment.

        -> In order build and docker image from an application we have to copy the content of the application on the docker files, it could be an artifact that we build.
