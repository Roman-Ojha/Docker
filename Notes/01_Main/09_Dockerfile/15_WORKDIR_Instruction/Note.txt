*) WORKDIR Instruction:
    -> https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/#workdir
    -> The 'WORKDIR' instruction sets the working directory for any 'RUN', 'CMD', 'ENTRYPOINT', 'COPY' and 'ADD' instructions that follow it in the Dockerfile. If the 'WORKDIR' doesn't exist, it will be created even if it's not used in any subsequent Dockerfile instruction.
