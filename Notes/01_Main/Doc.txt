NOTE: if we are using windows home os that we have to install virtual box and then install windows pro then install docker tool box
=> we have to enable virtualization in pc to use docker tool box VM 

=> While learning this tutorial docker tool box is depricated and the new Docker Desktop version came out

=> Setup:
    -> install Docker Desktop
    -> install Ubuntu (WSL v2) while this tutorial
        -> in Ubuntu terminal:
            -> docker run -d -p 80:80 docker/getting-started
            -> if it says Go permission denied then:
                -> sudo groupadd docker
                -> sudo usermod -aG docker ${USER}
                -> su - ${USER}
                -> docker ps -a (to test)
                -> finally:
                    -> docker run -d -p 80:80 docker/getting-started

-> docker version (in terminal)
    -> Client:
    -> Server:
        -> docker have two componend which are client and server
            -> Client:
                -> from where we are using docker 
            -> Server:
                -> where docker is running

-> docker run hello-world

#) Docker Client and Docker Server
    -> Docker client is a tool we issue commands to for reaching out to docker daemon(docker server)
    -> The Docker doemon is a service that runs on your host operating system. it is responsible for running containers

    -> when we will command:
        -> docker run hello-world
            -> Docker client and server will receive the request and check does 'hello-world' image avilable in the pc if it is avilable it means that, that image had been stored as the cache into the pc and it will get that image and install it from the cache
            -> if it didn't find the image in the cache then it get the image from the free service called docker hub and make a container for that
                -> https://hub.docker.com/

-> docker run busybox
    -> it will install the image
        -> docker run busybox echo hello roman
            -> <docker run busybox> => run busybox image and create a container
            -> <echo hello roman> => and the startup command of that container run it by 'hello roman'

        -> docker run busybox ping youtube.com
        -> docker run busybox ls
            -> will who us the folder inside the busybox
        -> docker run busybox sh
            -> it will run the shell and come out of that shell

*) Command
        -> docker ps (show all the images that are running)
            -> Container id: container id will uniquilly identify the container
            -> Image: image is the name of that image
            -> Command: startup command

        -> docker rm <container_id>  # Removes a stopped container

        -> docker rm -f <container_id> # Forces the removal of a running container (uses SIGKILL)

        -> docker rmi <image_id>  # Removes an image # Will fail if there is a running instance of that image i.e. container

        -> docker rmi -f <image_id>    # Forces removal of image even if it is referenced in multiple repositories, # i.e. same image id given multiple names/tags, # Will still fail if there is a docker container referencing image

        -> docker kill <CONTAINER ID> (if by commanding docker stop if container didn't responde and stop the container then we will kill or terminate that container)

        -> docker create hello-world (this will create a 'hello-world' container)

        -> docker start -a 4e62437a1204a3caaf4a66835b6e52c45f06aa86eb5c6374165753f91d42dff8 (this will start the container)
            -> -a(attached) display the output that contain inside the container

        -> docker run redis (to run docker image):
            -> docker logs <redis Container ID> (it will show that contain inside the container)

        -> docker exec -i -t <Container ID> sh (to go inside the shell of that container and run can run other command as well)
                -> -i (it will run the command which we had write inside the container)
                -> -t (show the thing that is return in prety)
                -> sh (it will run the terminal inside the given container)


*) Custom Images Using DockerFile
    *) DockerFile:
        -> A DockerFile is a blueprint for building a docker image
        -> Ex:
            -> if we are making a website and have files in github:
                -> index.php
                -> in.html
                -> base.html
                -> utils
            -> and we are trying to run the website by installing:
                -> apache 2 (server)
                    -> configure apache 
                -> pull code from git
                -> install other dependencies
                -> restart the server
            -> there is a chance that we will get an error because in those condition website devlopor did and in the condition that we are in right now in our pc that might will not match the requirement and will throw an error
            -> to solve that problem we will create the DockerFile 
            -> DockerFile container all the information that how to run the website in this example
            -> So, Dockerfile contains all the info for running your software in a base container

    *) DockerFile --> Image:
        => DockerFile contain plain text
        => DockerFile request the dockerClient to create the image of the file
        => DockerClient request the DockerServer to create the image of the file
        => DockerServer will create a usable image
        => DockerFile --> DockerClient --> DockerServer --> UsableImage

*) How To create A custom Image?
    -> step 1: Choose a base image
    -> step 2: Run commands for your software
    -> step 3: Spacify the base command
j

*) Creating our own custom image:
    -> first we will create a 'Dockerfile' file in project directory
    -> we will start from alpine (alpine is the light weight linux distro)
    -> and write some dockerfile
    -> docker build . (to build the created image)
        -> we will get the container id
        -> docker run <Container Id> (to run the custom container)


*) Tagging Image:
    -> docker build -t roman/redis:latest .
        -> -t = we want to add a tag inside this image
        -> roman = docker username
        -> radis = image name
        -> latest = varsion
            -> docker run roman/radis

    -> docker run -it alpine sh
        -> apk add --update redis (we can run the command that we had created inside the shell)
        -> docker commit -c 'CMD "redis-server"' <alpine image container id> (this says that, commit inside the container with startup command 'redis-server')
            -> it means that what every is running in this container make a file system snapshot of that and then start the container with the given startup command
            -> then we will get the container id:
                -> docker run <Container ID>
